# Data Analysis - Preprocessing  :magic_wand:	

## Overview
In this project, I thoroughly analyzed a given dataframe, employing various techniques to extract insights and draw conclusions.

### Analysis Highlights:

### Initial Data Exploration:
- **Dataframe Import:** Loaded the dataframe from the provided `store_income_data_task.csv` file.
   
- **Observations:** Examined the first five records to understand the dataframe's structure and content.

- **Handling Missing Values:** Identified missing values per column to assess data quality.

- **Missing Data Analysis:** Investigated missing data in specific columns (`store_email`, `department`, and `country`) and provided insights into the reasons behind the missingness.

- **Classification of Missing Data:** Categorized missing data based on columns, providing rationale for each classification.

### Data Normalization and Standardization:
- **Scaling Techniques Decision:** Determined whether normalization or standardization was appropriate for specific examples within the dataset.

- **Data Visualization:** Visualized the distribution of a specific column ("EG.ELC.ACCS.ZS") from the countries dataset using a histogram.

- **Data Scaling:** Applied the appropriate scaling method (normalization or standardization) to the selected column ("EG.ELC.ACCS.ZS").

- **Comparison of Original and Scaled Data:** Visualized both the original and scaled data to assess the impact of scaling and gain deeper insights.

Throughout the analysis, the goal was to uncover valuable insights and patterns to inform decision-making processes and drive further exploration.
