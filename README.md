# Data Analysis - Preprocessing and Transformation 🪄✨

## 📊 Overview
This project showcases an end-to-end data analysis, with a strong focus on **preprocessing** and **data transformation** techniques. By carefully handling missing data, engineering new features, and applying scaling methods, this project ensures that the data is prepared for deeper analysis and insights. 💡

## 🔍 Key Data Transformation Highlights:

### 1. 🗂️ Initial Data Exploration:
- **📥 Data Import**: Loaded the dataset from the `store_income_data_task.csv` file.
- **👀 First Look**: Analyzed the first few records to understand the structure and spot any potential issues.
- **🔍 Missing Data Handling**:
  - Identified missing values across key columns (e.g., `store_email`, `department`, `country`).
  - Classified the missing data and provided insights into potential causes.

### 2. 🛠️ Data Transformation Techniques:
- **🚀 Feature Engineering**:
  - Developed new features from existing columns to enrich the dataset and add more predictive power.

- **📊 Data Aggregation**:
  - Summarized multiple records into higher-level metrics, allowing clearer identification of trends and patterns.

- **🔄 Column Transformations**:
  - Applied **log transformations** to reduce skewness and normalize data distributions.

- **🔢 Encoding Categorical Data**:
  - Transformed categorical variables into numerical format using **One-Hot Encoding** and **Label Encoding**, preparing the data for machine learning models.

### 3. ⚖️ Data Normalization and Standardization:
- **🔍 Scaling Decision**:
  - Evaluated whether **normalization** or **standardization** was more appropriate for specific columns (e.g., "EG.ELC.ACCS.ZS").
  
- **⚖️ Scaling Execution**:
  - Applied the appropriate scaling techniques to improve comparability and performance in subsequent analysis.

- **🔍 Comparison of Data**:
  - Visualized both original and scaled data to assess the impact of transformations, ensuring accuracy and integrity.

### 4. 📈 Data Visualization:
- **📊 Distribution Visualization**:
  - Created histograms to visualize the distribution of specific columns (e.g., "EG.ELC.ACCS.ZS") for better understanding of the data patterns.

- **🔄 Before-and-After Comparisons**:
  - Compared visualizations before and after transformations to highlight the effects of data manipulation on structure and distribution.
